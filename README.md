# 🏡 Airbnb Backend Clone

## Overview

This project is a backend clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to replicate core features such as property listings, bookings, user management, and reviews. The main goal is to build a robust, scalable, and API-driven backend that can serve as the foundation for a full-stack application or be integrated with a separate frontend (e.g., web or mobile).

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Implement essential Airbnb functionalities (user auth, listing management, bookings, reviews).
- Provide a modern and efficient API using GraphQL.
- Ensure secure, maintainable, and scalable backend architecture.
- Leverage Django’s built-in admin and ORM for rapid development.
- Store and manage relational data efficiently with PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Django** – Web framework for building robust backend systems.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database for structured and reliable data storage.
- **GraphQL (Graphene-Django)** – API layer for flexible and efficient data querying.
- **Django REST Framework** *(optional)* – For RESTful API support if needed.
- **Docker** *(optional)* – Containerized development and deployment.
- **JWT Authentication** – Secure token-based user authentication.

---

### 🔄 Entity Relationships Summary

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**

- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the main features implemented in the Airbnb Backend Clone, highlighting their purpose and contribution to the overall functionality of the platform.

### 📄 API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the **OpenAPI** standard, making integration with frontend clients seamless and well-structured. It also includes **GraphQL** for more efficient and flexible queries, and the **Django REST Framework** to expose RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

### 🔐 User Authentication
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles through dedicated endpoints (`/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`). Secure authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access or modify their data.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can list, edit, retrieve, or delete properties through endpoints such as `/properties/` and `/properties/{property_id}/`. This feature enables users to manage their rental spaces with ease and efficiency.

### 📅 Booking System
The booking system allows users to reserve properties for specific dates via `/bookings/` and `/bookings/{booking_id}/`. It handles all operations related to check-in, check-out, and booking modifications.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Payments related to bookings are handled securely via the `/payments/` endpoint. This feature ensures that financial transactions are tracked and processed efficiently.

### 📝 Review System
Guests can post and manage reviews about properties using `/reviews/` and `/reviews/{review_id}/`. Reviews help build trust among users and improve the quality of listings on the platform.

### 🚀 Database Optimizations
To maintain performance at scale, the backend employs **indexing** for frequently queried data and **caching** to reduce server load and latency. These strategies enhance the responsiveness and reliability of the system.


## 🔒 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of backend development, especially when dealing with sensitive user data, financial transactions, and personal property listings. The following measures are implemented to protect the system from unauthorized access and potential threats.

### 🔐 Authentication
We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure and stateless authentication. Tokens are issued upon login and required for accessing protected endpoints. This ensures that only verified users can interact with the system.

**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal data.

---

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is applied to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest). For example, only a host can create or manage property listings.

**Why it matters:** Ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to, preventing data tampering or misuse.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is implemented to control the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe. This helps mitigate brute-force attacks, spam, and abuse of resources.

**Why it matters:** Protects the server from being overwhelmed and helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

---

### 🧬 Input Validation & Data Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and other injection-based attacks.

**Why it matters:** Protects the integrity of the application and database.

---

### 💳 Payment Security
Sensitive operations like payments are secured using HTTPS and tokenized transaction processing. Integration with secure third-party payment providers ensures compliance with financial regulations.

**Why it matters:** Safeguards users' financial information and ensures trustworthy transactions.

---

### 🗝️ Secure Data Storage
Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., PBKDF2 or bcrypt), and sensitive information is encrypted when stored or transmitted.

**Why it matters:** Prevents data leaks and protects user credentials in case of a breach.

---

By implementing these security practices, the backend ensures a safe, reliable, and trustworthy platform for users to interact with.


## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)** are development practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, reduce manual errors, and enable faster, more reliable releases.

### 🚀 Why CI/CD Is Important

- **Automated Testing:** Ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Faster Delivery:** Streamlines the release process by automating builds and deployments.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Developers can integrate changes more frequently and confidently.
- **Reliable Rollbacks:** Enables safer deployments and quick recovery from failed updates.

### 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:** Automates workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment on code pushes or pull requests.
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render / DigitalOcean:** Platforms for automated deployment and hosting.
- **PostgreSQL Backups:** Schedule regular database backups as part of the pipeline.

By integrating CI/CD into the development workflow, the project becomes easier to maintain, scale, and ship with confidence.
