# 🏡 Airbnb Backend Clone

## Overview

This project is a backend clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to replicate core features such as property listings, bookings, user management, and reviews. The main goal is to build a robust, scalable, and API-driven backend that can serve as the foundation for a full-stack application or be integrated with a separate frontend (e.g., web or mobile).

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Implement essential Airbnb functionalities (user auth, listing management, bookings, reviews).
- Provide a modern and efficient API using GraphQL.
- Ensure secure, maintainable, and scalable backend architecture.
- Leverage Django’s built-in admin and ORM for rapid development.
- Store and manage relational data efficiently with PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Django** – Web framework for building robust backend systems.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database for structured and reliable data storage.
- **GraphQL (Graphene-Django)** – API layer for flexible and efficient data querying.
- **Django REST Framework** *(optional)* – For RESTful API support if needed.
- **Docker** *(optional)* – Containerized development and deployment.
- **JWT Authentication** – Secure token-based user authentication.
- **Celery & Redis** *(optional)* – Background task processing (e.g., email notifications).
